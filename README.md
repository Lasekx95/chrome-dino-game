chrome-dino-game ***Bunny Remake***

This is remake of the chrome dino game you can find on the chrome browser.
It was made originally as a project for fun but adapted as a final project for a JavaScript course at my post-secondary,
while focusing on a responsive design to allow it to be played on varying displays(mobile included).

notes:
 1. FPS is displayed via console
 2. Added support for Safari Mobile
 3. Canvas scales to fit viewport(full mobile support)
 4. implemented use of delta timing(frame time delta)




Press space to start or on mobile, touch the screen.
Upon game over, press start again or touch the screen to restart.

I'll eventually add a feature to increment game speed over time to add further difficulty as well as a highscore!
